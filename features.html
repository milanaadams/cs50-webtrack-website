        <h3>Examples of Social Marketing Packages</h3>
        <p>The most important thing to consider when creating your social media marketing packages is what it is that you want to offer, and how you want to scale those offerings.<br><br>

            Do you want to offer general social media marketing? Have a baseline “standard” package with two profiles, 10 posts per week total, one monthly report. You can increase this with a “plus” package that allows for four profiles and 20 posts per week, with a monthly report and a strategy session. Then have the “ultra” package, which includes 6 profiles, 30 unique posts per week, a monthly report, a strategy session, and a bi-monthly audit.<br><br>
            
            You also have the option to scale up in services. Maybe your baseline package will just include social media content creation and scheduling. Your mid-level package includes strategy and reporting, and your plus offers full engagement monitoring and management.<br><br>
            
            In addition to your main packages, you can offer “add-ons,” which users can pay for individually or add on as part of their retainer. These may include:
        </p>
        <ul class="features__list">
            <li>One-time strategy creation, or ongoing strategy creation and assessment</li>
            <li>Social engagement and management</li>
            <li>Ad campaigns creation, publication, and management (typically not including ad spend in the retainer; the client has to pay for that themselves)</li>
            <li>One-time social events, like a social media contest or creating/promoting a Facebook event</li>
            <li>Hosting an on-social event, like a Twitter chat.</li>
        </ul>
